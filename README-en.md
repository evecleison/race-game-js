## Project Description

This project is a racing game developed as an assignment for the Web Technologies I course. Inspired by the classic Atari game *Enduro*, the game was built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without using Canvas. The player controls a car in an infinite race, needing to overtake opponents, avoid barriers, collect nitros (optional), and refuel at gas stations along the way. The goal is to achieve the highest possible score before running out of fuel or crashing.

## 🕹️ Features

1. Infinite racing with a scoring system based on overtakes.

2. Random elements on the track:

    🚘 Opponent cars  

    ⛽ Gas stations  

    🚧 Barriers  
    
    ⚡ Nitros

3. Colliding with opponent cars ends the game.

4. Hitting barriers causes point loss.

5. The car's fuel decreases every second. If it runs out, the game ends.

6. Gas stations allow refueling.

7. Nitros increase speed and grant extra points.

8. Leaving the track reduces speed by 15% per second (up to a limit).

9. Four scenarios available in the start menu: day, afternoon, night, snow.

10. Automatic scenario change every 30 seconds in the order: day → afternoon → night → snow → day...

11. Final screen displays the score and the number of refuels performed.
